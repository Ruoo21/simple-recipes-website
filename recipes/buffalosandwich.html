    <h1>Slow Cooker Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches</h1>
    <img src="../images/buffaloSandwich.jpg" alt="A picture of a buffalo sandwich">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe should take you only about 10 minutes to prepare, serves 6 people, and takes 6 hours to cook. Personally, I like adding blue chesse or ranch dressing, and think that these sandwiches are perfect for those days spent watching football.</p>    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>

        <li>1 (17.5 fluid ounce) bottle Buffalo wing sauce, divided</li>

        <li>Â½ (1 ounce) package dry ranch salad dressing mix</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>

        <li>6 hoagie rolls, split lengthwise</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken breasts into the slow cooker; pour in 3/4 of the wing sauce and ranch dressing mix.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook on Low for 6 to 7 hours.</li>
        <li>Shred chicken in the cooker with two forks. Stir in butter.</li>
        <li>Pile shredded chicken and sauce onto hoagie rolls. Serve with remaining Buffalo sauce.</li>
    </ol>
